Hi! I’m **Shuaiang Rong**, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Illinois Chicago](https://ece.uic.edu/).  

My work focuses on developing artificial intelligence for power systems, environmental hazard prediction and sustainability. I design and implement advanced deep learning methods that integrate computer vision, remote sensing, and signal processing, with applications in **vegetation management for power line monitoring, renewable energy integration (PV/wind), wildfire/flood spread forecasting, and IR-based window air-leak detection**. I am passionate about building models that are both accurate and efficient, enabling deployment in real-world systems where resilience and sustainability are critical.

## My work and research


My research lies at the intersection of power systems, renewable energy, and artificial intelligence, combining methods from power electronics, control, optimization, signal processing, and deep learning.  

I am broadly interested in developing multidisciplinary approaches that integrate traditional power engineering, signal processing with cutting-edge deep learning to address real-world challenges in grid resilience, renewable integration, and environmental hazard monitoring.    


Some of my previous work has explored:  
- Inverter-based resources control and protection in weak distribution/subtransmission systems, including modeling, simulation, and fault analysis.  
- Machine learning techniques for renewable energy integration and system stability.  
- AI-driven applications such as wildfire/flood spread forecasting, vegetation management around power lines, and infrared-based air-leak detection.  
- Deep learning and computer vision frameworks for remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and adversarially robust model design.  

A central theme of my work is integrating signal processing techniques — such as Gaussian filters and the Hadamard Transform — into deep learning models as trainable pre-filtering layers. This enables the development of lightweight AI models that leverage frequency-domain learning to improve robustness, efficiency, and interpretability. At a high level, my goal is to design reliable, scalable, and practical solutions that connect advances in AI with the needs of modern energy and infrastructure systems.

## My background and history

I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering (Automation) and M.S. in Electrical Engineering (Power Systems) from Shanghai University of Electric Power in 2015 and 2018, respectively. I joined the University of Illinois Chicago in 2019 for my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  

Alongside my academic training, I gained industry experience as an intern with [Quanta Technology](https://quanta-technology.com/) in 2023 summer, where I worked on power distribution line monitoring and customer outage prediction projects for a case study in Puerto Rico. My broader academic trajectory reflects a strong foundation in both power systems and power electronics and emerging deep learning methodologies for sustainability and hazard mitigation.

## My academic community
I am an active member of the IEEE Power & Energy Society and IEEE Women in Engineering. I regularly review for journals such as *IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery* and *Signal, Image and Video Processing*. I have published in leading IEEE journals and conferences, including *Transactions on Power Delivery*, *IEEE PES General Meeting*, *IEEE ECCE*, and *ICASSP*.  

Beyond research publications, I collaborate with colleagues across electrical engineering, computer vision, and geospatial analysis. I enjoy mentoring undergraduate researchers and presenting my work at academic and professional events.
